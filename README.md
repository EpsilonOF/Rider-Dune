# Rider-Dune

## Project Overview
Rider-Dune is a Java-based implementation of two classic arcade games. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and game development concepts using Java.

## Games Included
1. **Rider** - A modern take on the classic line rider game where players navigate a character along paths while avoiding obstacles.
2. **Dune** - Inspired by desert racing games, this implementation challenges players to navigate dunes and collect items while maintaining speed and control.

## Features
- Clean object-oriented architecture
- Smooth game mechanics and controls
- Score tracking system
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Custom graphics and animations

## Technical Details
- **Language**: Java
- **Graphics**: Java AWT/Swing
- **Project Structure**: Model-View-Controller pattern

## Getting Started
